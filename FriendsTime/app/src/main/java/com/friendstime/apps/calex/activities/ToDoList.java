/* 1. Either test or rethink design for "Upcoming Events". Currently the method is redrawing the array list every time.
However, the concern is that this process may be expensive and provide a user delay. Currently no delay is being experienced,
but with possible increased functionality such as pictures, expensiveness wil increment. Possible suggestion - limit # of events,
but still must be tested.

    2. Green status button not displayed until calendar view is refreshed. Figure out how calendar works, take care of it. Button
    IS removed/added when event is added or created, just doesn't show until calendar view is refreshed.

        - SIDE NOTE:
            1. consider design for multiple events, how to display their status in small calendar cell
            2. sync the actual status with the status button

    3. Upon launch of application, selected date is shown but no data is produced until you click the calendar.
